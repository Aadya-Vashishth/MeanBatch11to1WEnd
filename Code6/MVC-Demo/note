ng-app="greetapp"  —> from here we bootstrap the angular by using ng-app, and along with we are loading our module in this case it is greet app.

Model - Contains the Logic or Server Communication Code
To Build a Model in Angular JS 
we need to use factory or service

Factory contains logic and logic we write inside the functions
and we wrap all the functions into a single object and we return 
the object to the controller , so controller can call the factory methods by using the returned object.
// Factory Always return an object
module name.factory(“factory name”,function(){
var object = {};
return object;
});

Controller —> Controller is a Glue B/w View and Model.
Controller Role
1. Take Data from View 
2. Give it to Factory (Model)
3. Get the Processed Result from Model and give it to view

$scope - It is a predefine service in angular js and it is used to communicate b/w view and controller
Each Controller has there own $scope. So $scope is local for each controller.
$scope is for JS Term is a object.
